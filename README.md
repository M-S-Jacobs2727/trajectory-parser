# Dumpfile Parser

This is two simple libraries (one in Python and one in C++) to parse a set of frames from LAMMPS dump files (binary or text format, multiple frames per file or a single frame per file) and return the contained data as a Frame object. Testing will reveal if the Python version is significantly slower or similar (unlikely to be faster).
